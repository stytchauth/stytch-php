        * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a User's WhatsApp. If you'd like to create a user and send them a
        * passcode with one request, use our
        * [log in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/whatsapp-login-or-create) endpoint.
        *
        * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
        *
        * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
        * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
        * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your
        * app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
        *
        * ### Add a phone number to an existing user
        *
        * This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a
        * `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send one-time passcode by WhatsApp request will add
        * the new, unverified phone number to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates
        * within 5 minutes, the new phone number will be marked as verified and remain permanently on the existing
        * Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object, and any subsequent login requests using
        * that phone number will create a new User.
        *
        * ### Next steps
        *
        * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call
        * [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the
        * `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
